{"name":"Web Map Layer-Specific Feature Identification","description":"If the NGW webmap layer item 'identifiable' setting is turned off, layers connected through 'addNgwLayer' will not be interactive in the frontend. This ensures that specific layers have identification disabled, preventing feature highlighting and event processing for these layers."}
